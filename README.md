# Kargo Software Engineer Intern Online Assessment

## About Me
* Hi, you have reached Neel Haria's GitHub link for an potential internship opportunity at Kargo as an Software Engineer. While you're here, feel free to have a look at some other interesting projects I have done.
* I am Neel Haria, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology, Hoboken, NJ. 

## Introduction to the Problem
### Question
Conver an array of integers into an array of strings representing the phonetic equivalent of the integer.
### Example
1. Given an Array: [3,25,209], print "Three, TwoFive, TwoZeroNine" into stdout.
2. Given an Array: [10,300,5], print "OneZero, ThreeZeroZero, Five" into stdout.

## Approach
1. Take input from console.
2. Convert input element into string.
3. Use Map/dictionary/Key-Value pairs to store Phonetic equivalents i.e. '0' = "Zero", '1' = "One" and so on. 
4. Iterate over converted input elements to map values in the dictionary created in step 3.
5. Store result in array for each input element.
6. Return final result array.

## Usage
The Assessment is done in three languages, commands to execute the same is given below. 
1. C++

            g++ main.cpp -o main
            main.exe 101 102 103
      
2. Python

           python main.py 101 102 103  
          
4. JavaScript(Node)
